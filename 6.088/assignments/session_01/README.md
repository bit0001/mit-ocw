### Assignment 1: Introduction to C

1. Obtain GCC, either from installing (gcc.gnu.org) or from running it on MIT servers.
2. Figure out how to run GDB (gdb) and Valgrind (valgrind).
3. Compile and run the "hello world" program.
4. Extend the "hello world" program to print the current time. Hint: look at C's ctime (time.h) library.
5. Submit your modified hello_world.c program along with a README that describes 1) the command(s) you used to compile your program and 2) the command(s) you used to run your program. Please put the files into a single compressed .zip or .tar.gz file.
