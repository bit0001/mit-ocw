### Assignment 2: Introduction to C Memory Management


1. Write insert, find_val, and delete_bst in code we have included.
2. Write tests and make sure your code works.
3. Use valgrind to see if your code leaks memory.
4. Submit all of your files in a compressed .zip or .tar.gz file along with a README describing 1) the command(s) you used to compile your program and 2) the command(s) you used to test your program. If you choose to include tests, you should also describe them. If you used a Makefile, please include that as well.
