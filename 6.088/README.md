## 6.088 Introduction to C Memory Management and C++ Object-Oriented Programming

This is a "C/C++ empowerment" course where you will understand:

1. Why you would want to use C over another language (control over memory, probably for performance reasons)
2. Why you would want to use C++ rather than C (objects)
3. How to be useful in C and C++.
